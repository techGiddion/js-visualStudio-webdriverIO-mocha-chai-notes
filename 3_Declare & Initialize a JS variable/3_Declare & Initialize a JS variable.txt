//	var
>>	Declare first initialize later or Initialize & declare together.
	Redeclared and Reinitialize
	Scope [Global and function level only]
	while declaring Automatic initialised to undefine

//	let
>>	Declare first initialize later or Initialize & declare together.
	Reinitialize but not Redeclared
	Scope [Global and Block level only]
 
//	const
>>	Declare & Initialize  together.
	Neither Re-declared nor Reinitialize
	Scope [Global and Block level only]

//	without keywords
>>	A variable initialize but not declared will look for a scope to attach itself to. That means it will traverse up the 
	food-chain of scope until a variable with the same name is found. 	
	If none is found, it will be attached to the top-level scope (which is commonly referred to as global)
